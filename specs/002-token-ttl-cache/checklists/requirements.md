# Specification Quality Checklist: Reliable LiteLLM Token TTL Cache

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The spec references platform-specific file paths and commands (`stat -f %m`, `0600` permissions) in requirements — these are part of the problem domain (file caching behavior), not implementation choices, so they're appropriate.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed. The feature is well-scoped: fix the existing cache so it reliably prevents repeated 1Password prompts, across all supported platforms.
